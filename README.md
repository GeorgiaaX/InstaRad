# InstaRad

## About the Project
The InstaRad project is an industry Instagram clone web application created for use by radiography health professionals to share interesting x-rays and scans. Users can create an instaRad account and interact with other users by creating new image posts to share, liking interesting posts, and leaving comments for other users to interact with. Posts are displayed in an infinite scroll feed, that sorts posts chronologically by creation date. To activate an instaRad account, users must sign up and log in to interact and engage with other users of the platform.

## How it's made 
Tech used: HTML, CSS, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, Bootstrap, Passport.js, Handlebars.js.

The application is developed using Node.js, with the versatile and responsive Express.js framework at its core. It employs Passport.js as an authentication middleware, offering seamless user login and signup features to deliver a secure and personalized user experience. Additionally, it includes session management to allow users to stay logged in for a specific period. Data storage is managed by MongoDB, and enhanced by Mongoose to create structured and organized data models for users and stories.

Incorporating Multer for efficient file uploads and Cloudinary for cloud-based media management, the application offers robust multimedia handling capabilities. Bootstrap, as the chosen CSS framework, ensures a visually appealing and consistent user interface across the entire application. Handlebars.js serves as the templating language, enabling dynamic content rendering. This combination of these technologies results in a well-rounded and feature-rich platform for users to enjoy. 

## Lesson's Learned
InstaRad is an application that was created for Radiographers to connect with other users who have an interest in medical imaging. During the process of building this application, I learned how to effectively incorporate Multer for efficient file uploads, as well as use Cloudinary for cloud-based media management. Learning these tools will allow me to incorporate Multer and cloudinary into future projects that require file uploads and multimedia management. 

## Modifications
Modifications for this app in the future will focus on, enhancing the user experience of being able to upload multiple files in a single post. As well as enabling following and follower functionality so that the application becomes a more personalized experience for users.
